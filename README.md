# Summative 2

*Optional - consider changing this README to represent your project when complete*

## Objectives
 
- Analyse one dataset contained within this repository
- Use Markdown to write a formal lab report: hand the output in separately through Blackboard
- Include all required Rscripts and Rmd files needed to fully reproduce your report here
- Submit this repo to the GitHub Classroom by the assignment deadline


## Datasets

### Studying the effect of the gene *raga-1* on longevity and reproduction in the nematode worm (*C. elegans*)

- Dataset: Elegans.xlsx

- Excel workbook format - needs changing to csv or alternative readxl::read_excel

- Note: four tabs in workbook

F0 : Parental generation

F1: Offspring

rnai: dsRNA treatment of nematodes targeting either the raga gene or ev (empty vector control) for gene expression knockdown

treatment: dark or light exposure to light or dark (light is a stress environment for the nematode)

replicate/plate: replicate

day: day on which offspring measurement recorded

offspring: number of offspring produced

parental treatment: light or dark conditions experienced by the subjects parents (cross-generational effect?)

set_up_date: "Birthday" of nematode

death_date: Day death recorded for nematode

### Malarial infection status and body condition in the Seychelles Warbler (*Acrocephalus sechellensis*)

- Dataset: warbler.xlsx

- Excel workbook format - needs changing to csv or alternative read_excel

Bird identity: Unique lifetime ID for each bird

Sex: 1= male, 0= female 

Ageclass: CH: Chick, FL: Fledgling, OFL: Older Fledgling, J: Juvenile, SA: Sub-Adult, A: Adult

Body mass g : Body mass in grams

Right Tarsus Length: 

Malaria:  1= yes, 0 =no

Year: year measurements taken

"" : Monsoon season

### Behavioural studies of the two-spot ladybird (*Adalia bipunctata*)

CSV file

Ladybird ID: unique identifier
Sex: (F)emale, (M)ale
Age: Age in days

Mass.ave: Average mass in grams

Width: Measure of beetle width in mm

Length: Measure of beetle length in mm

Avg_area: Area of beetle in mm^2

Tuck.mean: ladybird were tipped onto their backs and provoked into their defensive position with legs tucked in (assay of shyness/boldness). Timed how long they stayed tuck 

Right.mean: How long it took them to right themselves from being tipped once they started trying (measure of vigour/condition)

Shelter.mean: how long it took them to emerge from a shelter (assay of shyness/boldness)

NSA.contact.mean: New surface assay: number of times they contacted a new surface in their arena 

NSA.time.mean: Time before exploring new surface (assay of explorativeness)

P.contact.mean number of contacts with an aphid prey before attacking it
