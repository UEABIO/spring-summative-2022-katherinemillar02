### Investigating the effect of rnai treatment on the longevity of c elegans 

### Abstract 

### Introduction
 
Caenorhabditis elegans are a widely used as a model organism in biology. They are often used to test for epigenetic effects, and how the life history of the parents of the c.elegans will affect their offspring. Both the longevity and fertility of organisms are influenced by both diverse genetic and environmental factors (Hamilton et al, 2005). 
Stress can be an influential factor on longevity in organisms, as well as fertility. There have been previous studies into how particular rnai treatments such as using the raga-1 gene, can affect both longevity and reproduction in the c. elegans  (nematode worm). 
raga-1 is the (main) gene involved in the determination of adult lifespan  (WormBase, 2022).  


 
I hypothesise that the raga-1 gene being the dsDNA target gene will therefore have a direct effect on decreasing how many offspring a c.elegans will have as well as decreasing longevity both in themselves and in their offspring. 

Mini hypothesisises 

1. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their longevity 
2. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their reproduction
3. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings longevity 
4. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings reproduction 

f0 - does stress (light) have an affect on their own longevity 

 model 1 - f0 lifespan based on THEIR rnai gene and treatment 
f0 - longevity, rnai, treatment 
 model 2 - f0 longevity based on whether they were in light/dark
f0 - longevity, treatment
 model 3 - f0 amount of offspring based on rnai gene and treatment 
f0 - offspring, rnai, treatment
 model 4 - f1 longevity based on their parent's rnai and treatment
f1 - longevity, parent's rnai, parent's treatment
 model 5 - f1 offspring vs their parents rnai and treatment 
f1 - offspring, parent's rnai, parent's treatment
 model 6 - f1 longevity based on their treatment and their parent's treatment 
f1 - longevity, parental treatment and treatment  






C elegans are known to develop over 3-4 days when in the laboratory (at 20 degree temperatures). 
Work by Schreiber et al, 2010 into looking at the raga-1 gene as an aging modulator has shown that c elegans that were engineered with  the ‘gain of function’ active raga-1 had a shortened lifespan while a mutant ‘dominant negative’ raga-1 lengthened lifespan. 


## Method

Replicates were performed for each of f0 and f1 generation reproduction, and for f0 and f1 lifespan. 
for f0 reproduction, there were 47 different replicates for a dark treatment, and 14 different replicates for a light treatment. 
for f0 lifespan, there were 6 different replicates for dark, and 5 different replicates for a light treatment. 
for f1 reproduction, there were 15 replicates for both light and dark treatment. 
for f1 lifespan, there were 6 replicates for both light and dark treatment.
