### Investigating the effect of rnai treatment on the longevity of c elegans 

### Abstract 

### Introduction
 

 
I hypothesise that the raga-1 gene being the dsDNA target gene will therefore have a direct effect on decreasing how many offspring a c.elegans will have as well as decreasing longevity both in themselves and in their offspring. 

Mini hypothesises:

1. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their longevity 
2. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their reproduction
3. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings longevity 
4. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings reproduction 



C elegans are known to develop over 3-4 days when in the laboratory (at 20 degree temperatures). 
Work by Schreiber et al, 2010 into looking at the raga-1 gene as an aging modulator has shown that c elegans that were engineered with  the ‘gain of function’ active raga-1 had a shortened lifespan while a mutant ‘dominant negative’ raga-1 lengthened lifespan.
