### Investigating the effect of rnai treatment on the longevity of c elegans 

### Abstract 

### Introduction
 
Caenorhabditis elegans are a widely used as a model organism in biology. They are often used to test for epigenetic effects, and how the life history of the parents of the c.elegans will affect their offspring. Both the longevity and fertility of organisms are influenced by both diverse genetic and environmental factors (Hamilton et al, 2005). 
Stress can be an influential factor on longevity in organisms, as well as fertility. There have been previous studies into how particular rnai treatments such as using the raga-1 gene, can affect both longevity and reproduction in the c. elegans  (nematode worm). 
raga-1 is the (main) gene involved in the determination of adult lifespan  (WormBase, 2022).  


 
I hypothesise that the raga-1 gene being the dsDNA target gene will therefore have a direct effect on decreasing how many offspring a c.elegans will have as well as decreasing longevity both in themselves and in their offspring. 

Mini hypothesisises 

1. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their longevity 
2. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has an affect on their reproduction
3. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings longevity 
4. f0 knockdown gene with treatment has affect on offsprings reproduction 

f0 - does stress (light) have an affect on their own longevity 

 model 1 - f0 lifespan based on THEIR rnai gene and treatment 
f0 - longevity, rnai, treatment 
 model 2 - f0 longevity based on whether they were in light/dark
f0 - longevity, treatment
 model 3 - f0 amount of offspring based on rnai gene and treatment 
f0 - offspring, rnai, treatment
 model 4 - f1 longevity based on their parent's rnai and treatment
f1 - longevity, parent's rnai, parent's treatment
 model 5 - f1 offspring vs their parents rnai and treatment 
f1 - offspring, parent's rnai, parent's treatment
 model 6 - f1 longevity based on their treatment and their parent's treatment 
f1 - longevity, parental treatment and treatment  






C elegans are known to develop over 3-4 days when in the laboratory (at 20 degree temperatures). 
Work by Schreiber et al, 2010 into looking at the raga-1 gene as an aging modulator has shown that c elegans that were engineered with  the ‘gain of function’ active raga-1 had a shortened lifespan while a mutant ‘dominant negative’ raga-1 lengthened lifespan. 


## Method

Replicates were performed for each of f0 and f1 generation reproduction, and for f0 and f1 lifespan. 
for f0 reproduction, there were 47 different replicates for a dark treatment, and 14 different replicates for a light treatment. 
for f0 lifespan, there were 6 different replicates for dark, and 5 different replicates for a light treatment. 
for f1 reproduction, there were 15 replicates for both light and dark treatment. 
for f1 lifespan, there were 6 replicates for both light and dark treatment. 

# Results and Discussion
```{r echo=FALSE}

```

A nematode worm usually lives best in dark conditions, as they are adapted to live in the soil. Conditions other than this, such as light conditions can be stated as a stressful condition and could be considered a factor for shorter longevity. 

# Hypothesis 1 - 

The hypothesis that stressful conditions in the f0 generation have an affect on their on longevity was tested

Previous research has indicated that there is a relation of stressful conditions and longevity of the nematode worm. Although, a connection between the two is known, the data for the exact reasons behind this is skewed (Zhou et al, 2011).
A factor to be considered, with nematodes, which are able to withstand an true affect of aging from stress, are known to have resistance to increased stress resistance. 



There was a significant overall effect on the longevity of the nematode worm of the f0 generation (Linear model:P=2.66^-77 ) with dark treatment to light treatment. 


A model which looked at the longevity of f0 was created based on whether or not they lived in light or dark conditions, as well as what gene knockdown treatment they had.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(model2table[, 1:4]), "model2table")
```

There was a reason to keep the interaction effect ( F= 0.006), and was kept in the model. 

It was found that there was a significant difference for dark treatment and light treatment  (F, -15.4, P=4.97^-42). 
There was significant difference in empty vector rnai treatment and raga-1 rnai treatment (F, 4.09, P=5.21^-5).

There was a significant effect on empty vector rnai and dark treatment to rnai raga-1 and light treatment (F-2.75, P=6.23^-3). 

# Hypothesis 2 - 

A model which looked at the amount of offspring the f0 generation had versus the rnai gene knockdown treatment they had, as well as if they lived in dark or light conditions was created. 

A model which looked at the longevity of the offspring of the f0 generation based on the offspring parent's rnai and parent's treatment during their lifetime. 
It was found that, 95% Confidence Interval (1.6-0.6), 
(P=0.371) for the difference in parental dark treatment and parental ev compared to parental light treatment and parental raga-1 treatment. 
Meaning there was no statistical significance difference, between the longevity of the offspring of f0 generation based on what rnai and treatment they had during their lifetime.
