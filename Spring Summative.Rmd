### The effect of rnai treatment on longevity 

### Abstract 

### Introduction
 
I hypothesise that the raga-1 gene being the dsDNA target gene will therefore have a direct effect on decreasing how many offspring a c.elegans will have as well as decreasing longevity both in themselves and in their offspring. 

Work by Schreiber et al, 2010 into looking at the raga-1 gene as an aging modulator has shown that the ‘gain of function’ raga-1 shortened lifespan while a ‘dominant negative’ raga-1 lengthened lifespan.
